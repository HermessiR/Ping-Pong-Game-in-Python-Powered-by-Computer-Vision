# 🏓 **Interactive Ping Pong Game with Hand Gestures** ✋

This Python program uses **OpenCV** and **Computer Vision** to create a fun and interactive ping pong game controlled by your hand gestures! ✨ The game tracks your hand movements in real-time, allowing you to control the paddle and hit the ball! 🎮

The hand detection is powered by the **`HandDetector`** module from the **`cvzone`** library. It’s a super cool way to interact with a game using just your hands! 🖐️

2. **Run the Code**
